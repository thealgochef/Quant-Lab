"""
Observation Manager — 5-minute observation window lifecycle.

Opens a window on TouchEvent, accumulates trades and BBO updates for 5 minutes,
then closes the window and computes features via FeatureComputer. Handles
feed drops (discard incomplete windows) and level deletions.

The model was trained on complete 5-minute windows only, so incomplete windows
(feed drops, level deletions) are discarded without feature computation.
